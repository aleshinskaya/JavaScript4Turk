# JavaScript4Turk
Javascript code for Amazon mechanical turk experiments

Users will need to edit the js/html code to suit their needs but this serves as a repo of hopefully useable and useful examples.
Some tutorials for using turk available here: https://bradylab.ucsd.edu/ttt/index.html


ObjectSort.html - code for showing draggable object images that participants can move on the screen, and saving their positions, ready to integrate into the Amazon m-turk interface
